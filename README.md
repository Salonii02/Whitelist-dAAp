1. Web3Modal : A single Web3 / Ethereum provider solution for all Wallets. https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal
2. Provider  : A Provider is an Ethereum node connection that allows you to read data from its state. You will use a Provider to do things like calling read-only functions in smart contracts, fetching balances of accounts, fetching transaction details, etc. Wallets like Metamask, by default, inject a Provider into your browser. Therefore, dApps can use your Metamask Provider to read values from the blockchain network your wallet is connected to.
3. Signer    : A Signer is an Ethereum node connection that allows you to write data to the blockchain. You will use a Signer to do things like calling write functions in smart contracts, transferring ETH between accounts, etc. To do so, the Signer needs access to a Private Key it can use for making transactions on behalf of an account.For this, Metamask also allows websites to request a Signer. So when a dApp attempts to send a transaction to the blockchain, the Metamask window pops up asking the user to confirm the action.
